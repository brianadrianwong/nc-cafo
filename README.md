# North Carolinian CAFO Change Detection in Earth Engine
Used a combination of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-7's archive for change detections of North Carolinian concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). Many thanks to Earth Engine for hosting the aforementioned archives. Analysis on such a large stack of imagery would not be possible otherwise.

Demo below was depoloyed for all of North Carolina. All in all, the workflow processed 1,497 Landsat-7 images in the final change-detection algorithm. The valid-mask creation from Sentinel-2 used 3,156 images from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017.
