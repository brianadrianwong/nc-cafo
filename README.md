# North Carolinian CAFO Change Detection in Earth Engine
Used a combination of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-7's archive for change detections of North Carolinian concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). Many thanks to Earth Engine for hosting the aforementioned archives. Analysis on such a large stack of imagery would not be possible otherwise.
